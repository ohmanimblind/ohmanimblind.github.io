             <p>As an Undergraduate Learning Assistant, I offered additional support for one of my favorite classes, CS111-Discrete Math. I would hold weekly office hours, typically 10-15, where students could come for assistance on homeworks, quizzes, or exams. I had an amazing time tutoring for this course, as not only did I enjoy the subject matter, but helping students better themselves is truly fullfilling.</p>

            <p> I worked all throughout my undergrad degree, and while it was difficult, it taught me two things. 1:I really love coffee , and 2: Knowing how to keep a good schedule. (Although I should really kick the coffee habit)</p>
