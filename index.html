                <h2><i>Some Words About Myself</i></h2>
		<p>While many say they wish to never see math again, I find myself seeing it everyday. One such concept I can't forget is The Uncertainity Principle, in where one cannot precisly know both a particles position and momentum at the same time. In an almost scary way, I feel the same way about myself. I can't exactly focus on both where I'm at, and where I'm going in life. But balancing that is one of life's most rewarding challenges. So where am I "at" now? Well as one could maybe infer, I love learning. I'm a firm believer that to be forever young is to be forever learning. And this includes any topic. STEM, music, sports, fragrances, linux, fountain pens card games, anything and all. My hobby is having hobbies. I love going to concerts, particularly in the alternative scene. I'm also a big advocate for self-hosting and DIY culture as a whole. ( My favourite math field is linear algebra ).  </p>

        <p> As a grader for the course, my responsibilites include grading exams, quizzes, and homework, at times making solutions. Due to the subject matter, grading was in fact trickier. However, I love this course and am happy to help in keeping the show going.

         </div>

             <p>As an Undergraduate Learning Assistant, I offered additional support for one of my favorite classes, CS111-Discrete Math. I would hold weekly office hours, typically 10-15 a week, where students could come for assistance on homeworks, quizzes, or exams. I had an amazing time tutoring for this course, as not only did I enjoy the subject matter, but helping students better themselves is truly fullfilling.</p>

          <p> As an IT technician at BearHelp, my main task was simple: Solving Problems. Whether it was normal Software Troubleshooting, Credential Issues, Fixing Email Routing, Reimaging Devices, etc., I was there doing my best. I preach about problem isomorphism, and working this position taught me I was right. Highlights were assisting with the Network Configuration for UCR's School of Buisness, and setting up new workflows between lower and higher level technicians. </p>

		I was able to grade for Professor Paea LePendu, who I also had for the course. My first time grading, an overall nice experience, as I also agreed with the Professor's approach to teaching. ( Also served as a good refresher going into my own Compilers course.

            <p> I worked all throughout my undergrad degree, and while it was difficult, it taught me two things. 1:I really love coffee , and 2: Knowing how to keep a good schedule. (Although I should really kick the coffee habit)</p>

		   <h2>Yap</h2>
		   <p>More random and telling facts about me. I like horror movies, as I think they are all not very good.  Consumption of life is the name to my game. I've consumed almost any and all media up until 2022 (life happened after). Name any movie, video game, music genre, show, I've either seen it or know many facts about it (except sports). My favorite music genre is Screamo/Scramz, although I also love post-hardcore. However, I listen to many genres, as I think limiting your music taste to one subset does one a disservice. My favourite manga of all time are 1. Jujutsu Kaisen, 2. Beck, 3. The Fable (one stands out more than the other). I used to run in highschool, my fastest mile was a 5:02 ( I wasn't that great ). I'm very injury prone, which is most likely due to my refusual to slow down. I rockclimbed for about a year, reaching V5. My favorite fragrance is Azzaro Most Wanted, but Dolce Gabanna Light Blue is a great runner up. My favorite game of all time is Fallout: New Vegas, where I have almost 3000 hours played (although my favorite game now is Warframe ). Since March 2025, I've used only a fliphone and an mp3 player for my day to day activites. I had an odd obssession with linux for a while (at the moment I use debian on my desktop and arch for my laptop). I used to collect and play Pokemon Competitivley (until I realized trying to afford cards while being a University Student is a death sentence). Now I collect Nenderoids. </p>
